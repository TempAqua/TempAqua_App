# User guide

This page provides information on how to use the TempAqua application.


## Project content

The TempAqua QGIS projects and layers are included in the `/qgis/TempAqua.gpkg` geopackage. 

![tt](static/qgis_gpk.png)



Two QGIS projects are available:
*  ![tt](static/qgis_small.png) TempAqua_manager : With this project, you gather data from field surveys and archive the data tables.

* ![tt](static/qgis_small.png) TempAqua_Qfield : This is used to set up mobile surveys. this project contains the same layers as the TempAqua_manager project, but without the archived tables. It is also configured to be used with QFieldCloud.




## How to work with TempAqua? 


To conduct a TempAqua Qfield survey, follow these steps:


1. Step 0: Initialize the two QGIS projects for the survey
1. Step 1: Set up and publish the QGIS projects to QFieldCloud
1. Step 2: Manage the QGIS projects on QFieldCloud
1. Step 3: Collect data in the field with Qfield
1. Step 4: Retrieve data from QFieldCloud to the local QGIS project
1. Step 5: Archive the data (optional)

## Step 0: Initialize the QGIS project for the survey.

### Initial publication


> These steps 1-6 should only be performed once during the project initialization process.

1. Create an empty folder where you want to store the project

2. Start QGIS (an empty project)

3. From QGIS, open the template project as follows: 
   
   - In QGIS > Browser > GeoPackage
     ![   ](static/deploy_step3.png)
   
   - Right click > New Connection ... > Open `.../TempAqua_App/qgis/TempAqua_Qfield.gpkg`
   
   - In `TempAqua.gpkg` > Double click `TempAqua` to open the project
     
     Loading the TempAqua template project provides access to fictitious data that can be edited as desired.

4. Convert the project to a QField project:
   
   - In QGIS > Browser > QFieldCloud > My projects
   - Right click > Create new project
     ![   ](static/deploy_step4.png)
   - Convert currently open project to cloud project (recommended)
   - Click Next and fill the required information
   - Chose you local folder
   - Close QGIS

5. Fix cloud settings in project:
   
   - Open the newly created QGIS project
   - In Layers panel > Right click on the segments layer > Properties 
        ![   ](static/deploy_step5.png)
   - In QField tab > change Cloud layer action to `Directly access data source`

6. Push changes to QFieldCloud:
   
   - Save project
   - Menu `Plugins` > `QFieldSync` > `Synchronize Current Cloud Project`







## Step 1: Set up and publish the QGIS project to QFieldCloud.

### Remove existing attributes

> We developed a set of scripts to automate the data collection process. These scripts are located in the `/qgis/` folder. The following sections describe how to use these scripts. The installation procedure is described [here](INSTALLATION.md).

This `TempAqua_empty_table.py` script allows the user to empty all attributes in a table except for the primary key and geometry. This can be useful when starting a new survey and wanting to clear the table to start from scratch while keeping the measurement locations.


To run a script

1. Double click on the script. The following window will appear:
![tt](static/tempAqua_archiving_3.png)
2. Select the layer you want to empty.
3. Click on `Run` button. The script will run and a log will be displayed in the window. 




### Publish a existing QGIS project and data on QFieldCloud


> These few steps are performed after the QGIS project has already been published on QFieldCloud and when you want to update it.


1. On GIS, click `Plugins` > `QFieldSync` > `Synchronize Current Cloud Project`

2. On the window that appears, click the `Prefer Local` button. This will upload the local project to QFieldCloud and overwrite the existing project.

3. Click `Perform Actions` button

## Step 2: Manage the QGIS project on QFieldCloud.

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/tutorials/get-started-qfc/) for more information on how to manage QFieldCloud projects.




## Step 3: Conduct a field survey and collect data with Qfield.

ðŸ“º [Step 3.1 - Get the project from the QfieldCloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempAqua/TempAqua_App/main/doc/static/step3_get_project.mp4)

ðŸ“º [Step 3.2 - Modify one feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempAqua/TempAqua_App/main/doc/static/step3_edit_attributes.mp4)

ðŸ“º [Step 3.3 - Add one feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempAqua/TempAqua_App/main/doc/static/step3_add_feature.mp4)

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.qfield.org/get-started/) for more information on how to manage QField projects on the mobile devices.



## Step 4: Retrieve data from QFieldCloud to the local QGIS project.

ðŸ“º [Step 4 - full video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempAqua/TempAqua_App/main/doc/static/step4.mp4)

To access the data from your field survey, you need to download the data from QFieldCloud to QGIS. This is done as follow:

1. On GIS, click `Plugins` > `QFieldSync` > `Synchronize Current Cloud Project`

2. On the window that appears, click `Prefer Cloud` button. 

3. Click `Perform Actions` button




## Step 5: Archive the data (optional).

ðŸ“º [Step 5 - full video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TempAqua/TempAqua_App/main/doc/static/step5.mp4)

After returning from the field survey, you may want to archive the data you collected. To do this, it is recommended that you create a separate project for archiving the data, rather than uploading it with the original field project.

We suggest using the `TempAqua_manager` project to archive the data. You can copy and paste the `anchor_point` and `media` layers into this project, and then run the `TempAqua_archiving.py` script to archive the data.

### Archive the survey data

> We developed a set of scripts `TempAqua_archiving.py`  to automate the data collection process. These scripts are located in the `/qgis/` folder. The following sections describe how to use these scripts. The installation procedure is described [here](INSTALLATION.md).


This script copies the modified features from one table to another. 



![tt](static/tempAqua_archiving.png)


To run the `TempAqua_archiving.py` scripts


1. From the `QGIS survey project` copy the table you want to archive and paste it in the `QGIS manager project`. 
1. Double click on the script. The following window will appear:
![tt](static/tempAqua_archiving_2.png)
1. Select the layer you want to archive.
1. Select the layer you want to use as archive.
1. Add optional information to be saved in the archived table. This information can be used to describe the survey or any changes made (e.g., indicate the date and time, names etc.).
1. Click the `Run` button. The script will run and a log will be displayed in the window. The log will indicate the number of features that have been archived.
