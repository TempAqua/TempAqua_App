# Introduction

![   ](doc/static/TempAqua-1024x576.jpg)

The TempAqua App allows for the detailed mapping of temporal streams and other ecohydrological features, as well as for documenting physical variables and soft data while in the field. 

The  application is configurable; users can import their maps and data, e.g., pre-defined observation locations and landscape features such as stream networks and catchment boundaries. 

With this, the  App helps users to navigate in complex terrain and to collect data at the correct locations. The  data collection with the TempAqua App is straightforward and intuitive: the users navigate to  interesting locations based on their current position and imported maps. Then, they enter the observations, such as the hydrological stream state, river discharge, water level, comments, photos, and even movies through the GUI. 

The App automatically connects stream sections on the map and color codes them depending on the hydrologic flow state so that the users immediately see the progress of their survey. The App does not require an internet connection during data collection in the field. An internet connection is only needed once when, after the survey, the users export their data directly to the archive. 

The App also syncs previoulsy exported surveys, so that all users with access to the same database can immediately retrieve information about previous surveys, which assures consistency in data collection when several researchers collect data for the same project in the same region.
